NOTE:
Only works with Hugo `0.119.0`. As of today, the latest version of Hugo/Wowchemy (now called HugoBlox) have changed a bunch of things that break the website. 

Download it for mac [here](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.119.0#:~:text=hugo_extended_0.119.0_darwin%2Duniversal.tar.gz)
Uncompress and move to `/opt/homebrew/bin`.

Tell your Mac not to worry about the file:
```
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /opt/homebrew/bin/hugo
```
