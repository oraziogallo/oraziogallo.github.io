I was a Principal Research Scientist and Senior Research Manager at NVIDIA Research. In the amazing 15 years I spent there, I worked on a wide range of topics and projects, ranging from computational photography, low-level computer vision perception, human visual perception, and content capture/generation.

During my tenure at NVIDIA I mentored or co-mentored stellar students now off to doing amazing things on their own. Interns were to me what grad students are to professors, so I'm hoping I made some small contribution to their career. But most of all, I'm thankful for the opportunity to have worked with them.
Here's a few, in no particular order:
- Dr. [Abhishek Badki](https://abadki.github.io/) (now with NVIDIA Research)
- Dr. [Hang Su](https://suhangpro.github.io/) (now with NVIDIA Research)
- Dr. [Jun Hu](https://junhu-svd.github.io/public_html/) (now with Apple)
- Dr. [Ekta Prashnani](https://prashnani.github.io/) (now with NVIDIA Research)
- Dr. [Chaoyang Wang](https://mightychaos.github.io/) (now with Snap Research)
- Dr. [Jae Shin Yoon](https://gorokee.github.io/jsyoon/) (now with Adobe Research)
- Dr. [Daniel Lichy](https://dlichy.github.io/) (now with Kitware)
- Prof. [Hang Zhao](https://hangzhaomit.github.io/) (now at Tsinghua University)
- Dr. [Yiqing Liang](https://lynl7130.github.io/) (now with Luma AI)
- Prof. [Suren Jayasuriya](https://sites.google.com/asu.edu/imaging-lyceum/team/current-members) (now at ASU)
- Prof. [Qi Guo](https://www.qiguo.org/pi) (now at Purdue)
- Prof. Chenyang Lei (now Prof. at CAIR)
- Prof. [Felix Heide](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~fheide/) (now at Princeton)
- Dr. David E. Jacobs (now with Google)
- Dr. [Patrick Wieschollek](https://patwie.com/) (now with Amazon)
- Dr. [Wei-Sheng (Jason) Lai](https://www.wslai.net/) (now with Google)
- Dr. Inchang Choi (now with Apple)
- Dr. [Zhile Ren](https://jrenzhile.com/) (now with Apple)
- Prof. [Huaijin (George) Chen](https://hgchen.com/) (now at the University of Hawaii at Manoa)
- Dr. Atsuhiro Noguchi (now at PreferredNetworks)
- Dr. [Tewodros Habtegebrial]() (now at Snap Spectacles)
- Seokju Cho (PhD student at KAIST)

I have served as area chair or senior area chair for several IEEE conferences (CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, WACV, and 3DV). I was an associate editor and then senior associate editor of the [IEEE  Transactions on Computational Imaging]("http://signalprocessingsociety.org/publications-resources/ieee-transactions-computational-imaging") from 2020 to 2024. From 2018 to 2022 I was a member of the [IEEE Computational Imaging Technical Committee]("http://signalprocessingsociety.org/get-involved/computational-imaging-special-interest-group"), and from 2015 to 2017 I was an associate editor for [Signal processing: Image Communication]("https://www.journals.elsevier.com/signal-processing-image-communication").
I got recognized as an outstanding reviewer for BMVC (2021), ICCV (2021), and CVPR (2017, 2018, 2021). I was also recognized as an outstanding editorial board member for my services to IEEE Trans. on Comp. Imaging (2020).

I am taking a break from research and tech for a bit. You can probably find me on the beach training for next year's beach volleyball season, or via email (first_name @ soe.ucsc.edu).
